    <h2 id="plans">Future Plans</h2>
    <p>In the future, I aim to create my own <strong>Islamic-based website</strong> where I can share valuable content about Islam, including teachings, stories, and resources to spread knowledge and inspire others. Alongside this, I also aspire to work in a <strong>software house</strong> to enhance my technical skills, gain practical experience, and collaborate with professionals in the field. Moreover, I have a strong desire to <strong>teach students</strong> whatever I learn, helping them grow in both <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>Islamic knowledge</strong>. My goal is to build a platform that not only supports my career but also empowers others by sharing knowledge and fostering a positive learning environment.</p>
